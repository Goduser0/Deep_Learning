# Coupled Generative Adversarial Network code

## General

This is the open source repository for the Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoupledGAN or CoGAN) work.  For more details please refer to our [NIPS 2016 paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6544-coupled-generative-adversarial-networks.pdf) or our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07536). Please cite the NIPS paper in your publications if you find the source code useful to your research.

I have improved the algorithm by combining with encoders. For more details please check our [NIPS 2017 paper on Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6672-unsupervised-image-to-image-translation-networks.pdf)

## USAGE

In this repository, we provide both [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) implementation and [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation. For using the code with the [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) library, please consult [USAGE_CAFFE](USAGE_CAFFE.md). For using the code with the [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) library, please consult [USAGE_PYTORCH](USAGE_PYTORCH.md).
